# Targeted Marketing Visualization Tool for Banks


## Introduction
Credit scores are a crucial factor that impacts financial decisions in the banking industry. 
Reducing credit risk is a major priority for banks, which emphasizes the need for careful loan distribution due to the possibility of losses.

The dataset available for analysis includes a variety of important attributes, such as financial and demographic parameters. Factors such as debt, loans, and total investments are important in determining creditworthiness.

The main focus will be on identifying target demographics for marketing based on the data's findings regarding occupations or loan types. Financial institutions can use this data to tailor their marketing strategies to specific occupations or potential borrowers of certain loans.

The objective of this task is to create a visual aid that can assist in making marketing decisions for a particular group. This involves plotting important characteristics against factors such as age and occupation to identify customers who manage credit effectively. The primary users of this visualization tool will be banks that are seeking customers who are less likely to have a poor credit score. This decision will be based on data from previous customers and their financial behavior.

The visualizations are intended primarily for exploration, enabling a more sophisticated understanding of the differences or similarities between individual profiles. A thorough understanding of the complex factors underlying creditworthiness assessments leads to more informed decisions by banks.

The preference for visualization methods over traditional statistical techniques arises from the fact that visual narratives can easily reveal intricate relationships between variables. Analyzing patterns, similarities, and connections in the historical data of past customers can help identify potential customers who may qualify as the next best candidates for receiving credit. Statistical methods do not allow for easy comparison of different aspects of the data. Instead, they only predict a credit score without providing a deeper level of comparison.
